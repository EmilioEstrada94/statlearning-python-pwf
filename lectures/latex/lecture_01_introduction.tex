	\begin{blurb}
			We'll discuss the content and goals of the course and introduce 
			the datasets we'll use, some mathematical notation and 
			the work environment.

			We (all of us) will need to spent some time to make sure everyone is 
			technically ready to go. 

			We'd like to get an impression of what you expect, what you know
			and what you want to learn.
