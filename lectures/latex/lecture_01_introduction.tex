	\begin{blurb}
			We'll discuss the content and goals of the course and introduce 
			the datasets we'll use, some mathematical notation and 
			the work environment.

			We will need to spent some time to make sure everyone is
			technically ready to go. 

			We'd like to get an impression of what you expect, what you know
			and what you want to learn.
