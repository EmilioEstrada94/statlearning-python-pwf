\begin{frame}{Abstract}
	\begin{blurb}
		We will only cover a subset of the sections in chapter 6 of the ISL book,
		namely the problem of high dimensional data.

		High dimensional data has become more and more common in statistical
		learning applications. It it therefore important to understand the implications
		and modern methods to mitigate the problem.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item High Dimensional Data
		\item The Curse of High Dimensions
		\item Feature Selection
		\item Principal Components
		\item Partial Least Squares
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This is part of what the ML community calls \e{feature enginieering}.}

\begin{frame}{High Dimensional Data}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Traditionally, most statistical learning techniques only involved
			a small number \\ of features, $p\sim\mathcal{O}(10)$, $n \gg p$.
		\item That is, the data was mostly \e{low dimensional}.
		\item For example, one might try to predict blood pressure from a few variables\\
			like BMI, age and gender.
		\item There are two reasons for this:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item High dimensional data could not be collected and stored.
				\item The involved computations were impossible to perform.
			\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
	\bl{This situation has changed dramatically over the last decades.}

			\begin{itemize}
				\item Gene expression data is a typical example.
				\item Instead of just BMI, age gender we now have
					access to measurements of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).
				\item At the same time, the number of individual observation
					is not much larger.
				\item A situation like $n\approx 200$ and $p \approx 500000$ is not uncommon.

\begin{frame}{High Dimensional Data}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We refer to data sets with $p \gg n$ as \e{high dimensional}.
		\item Regression, in particular least squares is impossible in these cases.
		\item But even if $n > p$ problems can arise.
		\item If $n$ is not much larger than $p$ we are in danger of over-fitting.
		\item At the very least we have to think carefully about the bias-variance trade-off.
