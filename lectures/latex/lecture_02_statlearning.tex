	\begin{blurb}
		We give a number of examples illustrating what statistical learning
		is about.
		
		The emphasis not on particular methods but on the foundational concepts.

	\end{blurb}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Models
		\item Prediction \& inference
		\item Accuracy  \& interpretability
		\item Bias \& Variance
		\item Regression \& classification
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This sets the stage for the remainder of the course.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Advertising}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We are hired to increase the sales of a particular product.
		\item We are given the \dat{Advertising} data set.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \dat{sales} for 200 different markets.
				\item advertising budgets for \dat{TV}, \dat{radio} and \dat{newspaper}.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Our clients can \emph{not directly} influence the sales.
		\item But they \emph{can} control the advertising budgets.
		\item We need to determine whether there is an association \\
			between advertising and sales. 
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This is a typical scenario.}
\end{frame}

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{2_1}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The plots display \dat{sales} as a function of the advertising budgets.
		\item Each plot is a \emph{scatter plot} of \dat{sales} versus a budget.
		\item We have overlaid a \emph{least squares line} fit on each plot.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{We can already spot some promising relationships.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Advertising}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The advertising budgets are \e{input variables}.
		\item We denote the input variables with $X$.
		\item We use subscripts to distinguish them.
		\item For example, $X_1$ = \dat{TV}, $X_2$ = \dat{radio}, $X_3$ = \dat{newspaper}.
		\item The input variables are also called \e{predictors}, \e{independent variables}, \\
			\e{features} or simply \e{variables}.
		\item \dat{sales} is the \e{output variable}.
		\item Output variables are also called \e{dependent variables} or \e{responses}.
		\item We denote the output variables with $Y$.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{Don't get confused by different names.}
