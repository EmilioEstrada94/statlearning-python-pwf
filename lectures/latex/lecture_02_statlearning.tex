	\begin{blurb}
		We give a number of examples illustrating what statistical learning
		is about.
		
		The emphasis not on particular methods but on the foundational concepts.

	\end{blurb}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Models
		\item Prediction \& inference
		\item Accuracy  \& interpretability
		\item Bias \& Variance
		\item Regression \& classification
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This sets the stage for the remainder of the course.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Advertising}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We are hired to increase the sales of a particular product.
		\item We are given the \dat{Advertising} data set.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \dat{sales} for 200 different markets.
				\item advertising budgets for \dat{TV}, \dat{radio} and \dat{newspaper}.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Our clients can \emph{not directly} influence the sales.
		\item But they \emph{can} control the advertising budgets.
		\item We need to determine whether there is an association \\
			between advertising and sales. 
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This is a typical scenario.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Example: Advertising}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{2_1}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The plots display \dat{sales} as a function of the advertising budgets.
		\item Each plot is a \emph{scatter plot} of \dat{sales} versus a budget.
		\item We have overlaid a \emph{least squares line} fit on each plot.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{We can already spot some promising relationships.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Advertising}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The advertising budgets are \e{input variables}.
		\item We denote the input variables with $X$.
		\item We use subscripts to distinguish them.
		\item For example, $X_1$ = \dat{TV}, $X_2$ = \dat{radio}, $X_3$ = \dat{newspaper}.
		\item The input variables are also called \e{predictors}, \e{independent variables}, \\
			\e{features} or simply \e{variables}.
		\item \dat{sales} is the \e{output variable}.
		\item Output variables are also called \e{dependent variables} or \e{responses}.
		\item We denote the output variables with $Y$.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{Don't get confused by different names.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Models}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Suppose we observe a \e{quantitative} response $Y$,\\
			and $p$ different predictors, $X_1, X_2, \dots X_p$. 
		\item We assume that there is some relationship between $Y$ and $X$.
		\item We can write this in the very general form
			\[ Y = f(X) + \epsilon\]
		\item Here $f$ is a fixed but unknown function of $X = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)$.
		\item And $\epsilon$ is a random error term, independent of $X$ with mean zero.
		\item We say $f$ represents the \e{systematic} information\\
			that $X$ provides about $Y$.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This is the most general form of a \e{model}.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Income}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{2_2}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The figure shows a scatter plot of \dat{income} versus \dat{years of education}.
		\item The blue curve is the true functional relationship $f(X) =f(X_1)$.
		\item The vertical lines represent the error terms $\epsilon$.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{This is a simulated data set.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Example: Income}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{2_3}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-5mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The figure shows a 3D scatter plot of \dat{income} versus \dat{years of education}
			and \dat{seniority}.
		\item The blue surface is the true functional relationship $f(X) = f(X_1, X_2)$.
		\item The vertical lines represent the error terms $\epsilon$.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{Visualising higher dimensions is hard.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What is Statistical Learning?}
	\begin{blurb}
		In essence, statistical learning refers to to a set of approaches for estimating
		the function $f$.

		In this lecture we cover the key theoretical concepts that arise in estimating $f$, as well
		as techniques for evaluating the estimates obtained.
	\end{blurb}
	\bottomline{This equally applies to machine learning.}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Why estimate $\bm{f}$?}
	%\begin{itemize}
		%\item There are two main reasons why we wish to estimate $f$.
	%\end{itemize}
		There are two main reasons why we wish to estimate $f$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \e{Prediction}: assuming the inputs $X$ are readily available, we simply want ot
			predict
			\[\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)\]
			without being interested in the exact form of $\hat{f}$.
		\item \e{Inference}: we want to understand the functional relationship
			\[Y = Y(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)\]
			between the predictors and the response.
	\end{enumerate}
	\bottomline{We discuss each in more detail.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prediction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Often the inputs $X$ are readily available but the response $Y$ is not.
		\item Since the error term $\epsilon$ averages to zero, we can then predict
			\[\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)\]
			where $\hat{f}$ represents the estimate of $f$ and $\hat{Y}$ is the resulting
			prediction of $Y$.
		\item In this scenario we are not interested in the exact form of $\hat{f}$.
		\item We are mostly concerned with the accuracy of $\hat{Y}$.
	\end{itemize}
	\bottomline{Here $\bm{\hat{f}}$ is treated as a \e{black box}.}
