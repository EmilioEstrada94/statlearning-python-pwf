The output will be displayed in an *Output* cell below the code cell. the output can be text from `print()` statements and the like, object representations (as on a Python prompt) or graphics.  Behind the scenes the notebooks use ipython.  Among other things, this means you can use *tab completion* for names in the current scope. \n",
