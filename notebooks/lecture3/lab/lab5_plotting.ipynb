    "# Producing Consistent Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "We have stressed earlier that visualisation is *very* important. A big part of this consistency. Unfortunately, this can be hard to achieve in Python ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `seaborn` library provides a consistent and well designed look and we generally recommend to use it for your plotting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some things `seaborn` can't do easily. In particular, we often want to plot quantities derived from a model the *we* have fitted.  That can be a problem, because many of `seaborn`'s convenience features (such as `regplot()`) do their own fits we have little control over. In fact, they will often be plain wrong! For example, when we fitted a multiple regression model. Yet, we still want `seaborn`'s consistent look.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many plots referred to in the ISL book are based on the convenient functions provided by R. Almost none of these are readily provided in the Python ecosystem, at least not with a consistent look and full control over the underlying model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we do about this? \n",
    "\n",
    "We have to write some code... as you have seen, this kind of thing is extremely tedious. But you are in luck, we did most of the work for you! All you have to do is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from islpy import datasets, utisl, lmplots\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will demonstrate some functions from the `lmplots` module in this lab.\n",
