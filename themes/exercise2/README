The main.css file changes the colour scheme to ICTP and removes the transition
animations.

Copy it to the relevant nbextensions/ folder.  If you installed the extensions
with --user that is:

	cp main.css ~/.local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/exercise2/



The main.js file fixes the check box defaults upon reload.

Copy it to the relevant nbextensions/ folder.  If you installed the extensions
with --user that is:

	cp main.js ~/.local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/exercise2/



The hide_main.js file does the same as main.js but forces all solutions closed
upon reload, independent of the saved notebook state.  I fyou prefer this
bahaviour, copy to the relevant nbextensions/ folder.  If you installed the
extensions with --user that is:

    cp hide_main.js ~/.local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/exercise2/main.js
