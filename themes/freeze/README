The hide_main.js hides the toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts such that
frozen cell can't be accidentillay unfrozen.  This is the preferred behaviour

To install, copy to the relevant nbextensions/ folder.  If you installed the
extensions with --user that is:

    cp hide_main.js ~/.local/share/jupyter/nbextensions/exercise2/main.js
